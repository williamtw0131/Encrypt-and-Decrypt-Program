This is a encrypt and decrypt Program
you can input request to start

the encrypt method is move the position by a random times(aka key)
and all the capital or dot question mark things like that will remain
output will give you the encrypted words and the key to decrypt.

the decrypt is just the other way around
but you have to input a right key(an interger and right to decrypt)
so that you won't get a nonsence words

that's all.
